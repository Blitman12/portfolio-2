            <p>I am a current Full Stack Bootcamp Student as well as a full time Registered Nurse. I graduated in 2016 with my Bachelor of Science in Nursing and immediately went to work in the Emergency Department for a few years until landing a job at American Express. Here I was introduced to the technology side of the world and was further introduced to web development and coding in March of 2020 by a close friend and current developer. After diving head in and learning HTML/CSS I was hooked watching something I created come alive on the screen. Later, I started to focus on React for its quick loading times, virtual DOM and customizability. This led me to developing a full stack application using the MERN stack. After seeing how the back end and front end come together, I was even more hooked. I am now a current Full Stack Bootcamp student and look forward to learning new things every day and eventually making my passion my career.</p>
